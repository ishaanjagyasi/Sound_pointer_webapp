# Ambisonic Sound Pointer

This is a webapp specifically made for pointing your sound around in an Ambisonic space by the virtue of the sensors in your mobile device.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js and npm:** Required to run the WebSocket-to-OSC bridge.
  * **ngrok Account & CLI:** You'll need a free `ngrok` account and the command-line tool installed.
  * **Python 3:** Used for a simple local web server (most systems have this pre-installed).
  * **An OSC Receiver:** Software like Max/MSP, Pure Data, Reaper, etc., ready to receive OSC messages on port **9000**.

-----

## One-Time Setup

You only need to do these steps once.

### 1\. Install Node.js Dependencies

Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and install the necessary Node.js packages:

```bash
# Installs the WebSocket and node-osc libraries
npm install ws node-osc
```

### 2\. Configure `ngrok`

The `ngrok` free plan requires you to define multiple tunnels in a single configuration file.

1.  **Add your authtoken.** Get your token from the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) and run:
    ```bash
    ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>
    ```
2.  **Create the configuration file.** Run `nano ~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml` and paste the following content. The indentation is very important\!
    ```yaml
    # ~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml
    version: "2"
    tunnels:
      webapp:
        proto: http
        addr: 8000
      websocket-bridge:
        proto: http
        addr: 8080
    ```
    Save and exit by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

### 3\. Create a Shell Shortcut (Recommended)

To avoid typing a long command every time, you can create a permanent shortcut.

1.  Open your shell's configuration file (e.g., `nano ~/.zshrc` or `nano ~/.bash_profile`).
2.  Add the following line to the end of the file:
    ```bash
    # Alias to start both ngrok tunnels for the OSC project
    alias ngrok-start="ngrok start --all --config ~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml"
    ```
3.  Save the file and reload your shell by opening a new terminal or running `source ~/.zshrc`.

## Usage Instructions

Follow these steps every time you want to run the controller.

1.  **Open your OSC Application** (e.g., Max/MSP) and make sure it's listening for UDP OSC messages on port **9000**.

2.  **Start the Node.js Bridge.** In a new terminal window, run:

    ```bash
    node websocket-osc-bridge.js
    ```

    You should see `WebSocket-to-OSC bridge running on port 8080`.

3.  **Start the Web Server.** In another terminal window, from your project directory, run:

    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```

4.  **Start `ngrok`.** In a third terminal window, run your shortcut:

    ```bash
    ngrok-start
    ```

    `ngrok` will display two public "Forwarding" URLs.

5.  **Connect Your Phone:**

      * On your phone, open the **`https://...ngrok-free.app`** URL that forwards to `localhost:8000`.
      * Copy the other `ngrok` URL (the one for `localhost:8080`).
      * Paste it into the input field in the web app, but make sure it starts with **`wss://`**.
      * Tap **Enable Sensors** and then **Start Sending**.

You should now see OSC messages in your Node.js terminal and the data flowing into your OSC application\!

## Troubleshooting

  * **`ngrok` Error: "must define at least one tunnel"**: This means your `ngrok.yml` file is missing, empty, or has a syntax error. Double-check the file content and its location (`~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml`).
  * **Web App Doesn't Connect**: Ensure the Node.js bridge is running. Verify you pasted the correct `ngrok` URL and that it starts with `wss://`.
  * **No Data in Max/MSP**: Look at the Node.js bridge terminal. If it says "Phone connected," the issue is likely with your Max patch. If it doesn't, the issue is with the phone connection.
